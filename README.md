**Project #2: Popular Movies app**

Project overview: In this second and final stage, the app has functionality more than Stage 1:
- allows users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- allows users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- also allows users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
- creates a database and content provider to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, 
the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
- modified the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
+ additional functions like searching in themoviedb.org database, sharing the film details and sorting by "now playing" movies
